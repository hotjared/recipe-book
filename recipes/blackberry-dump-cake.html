    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This blackberry dump cake is a crowd pleaser. Serve with ice cream or whipped topping.<br>
        Much like blackberry pie but instead its much neater and can feed a whole party!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 1/2 cups of fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup of unsalted butter, thinly slices</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package French vanilla cake mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix blackberries and sugar together in a bowl. Transfer to a <br>
        9x13-inch glass baking pan and spread evenly over the bottom.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cake mix evenly over the berries. Place the butter slices <br>
        evenly over the cake mix; most of the cake mix should be covered with butter slices <br>
        do not mix or stir.</li>

        about 45 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
